This is currently just a UI concept.

By adding the features, the application will become dependent on libraries and data structures that may be implemented much later than the actual system.

Until then, the application can be used as a proof of concept.

The book on creating and using Fintou mentions how to properly organize the files.

I am actively working on writing the book alongside this, so that it can be published along with the first usable version of the system.
